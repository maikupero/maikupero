🧗‍♂️ About me || 自己紹介:<br>

> I spent the last 7 years since graduation challenging myself to live abroad self-supported.
> 
> As a result, I've been a [teacher](http://coar.co.jp/), a [translator](https://amzn.to/3rX6Rxm), a [barista](https://backpackersjapan.co.jp/kyotohostel/en/), a [bike tour company founder & guide](https://biketourjapan.com), a [pilgrim](https://shikoku-tourism.com/en/shikoku-henro/shikoku-henro), a [travel interviewer (i.e Humans of New York)](https://www.instagram.com/sounds_of_japan/), a [photo](https://maikerupero.smugmug.com/Photography)/[videographer](https://youtu.be/dLvtdOi-5Dk), a [local business consultant](https://tecojapan.wordpress.com/), and a [web designer](https://stak.tech).
> 
> All of that is coming together in coding - my fulltime study and primary focus going forward.<br> 
> Please feel free to ask me about any of my experiences - I'd be happy to tell you about them, and feel confident that they have all held irreplacable value towards making me a more complete human and interestingly, a better programmer. 

📝 Approach || 勉強法:<br>
> Overall I'm approaching coding as a language, just as I taught myself Japanese to fluency. I try to balance these 4:
> + Deconstructive Approach - Daily problems and practice, algorithms and logic, developing the native mindset.
> + Constructive Approach - Lots of personal projects - try to make any idea you can conceptualize.
> + Fundamentals - Follow any course as far as it continues to feel interesting, useful and concise.
> + Community - Open-source projects, and as much collaboration and communication as possible.
