🛣 Timeline:
I spent my 20s pushing myself towards various challenges, projects and adventures, all while living abroad and self-supported. 

As a result, I've been a teacher, a translator, a barista, a bike tour company founder & guide, a pilgrim, a travel interviewer (i.e Humans of New York), a successful photo/videographer, a local business consultant, and a web designer.

All of that has led me here. I'm putting it all together in code which I have fallen in love with and will be my primary focus going forward. Please feel free to ask me about any of my experiences - I'd be happy to tell you about them, and feel confident that they have all made me a more complete human and a better programmer.

------------------------------ About My Learning ------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Balance of these 4:
• Deconstructive Approach - Daily leetcode and codewars problems, algorithms and logic, develop a coding mind.
• Constructive Approach - Lots of personal projects - try to make any idea you can conceptualize.
• Fundamentals - Any course that feels interesting, useful and concise.
• Community - Open-source projects, and as much collaboration and communication as possible.
