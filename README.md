🧗‍♂️ About me 自己紹介:<br>
        I spent my 20s pushing myself towards various challenges, projects and adventures, all while living abroad and self-supported. 

        As a result, I've been a teacher, a translator, a barista, a bike tour company founder & guide, a pilgrim, a travel interviewer (i.e Humans of New York), a successful photo/videographer, a local business consultant, and a web designer.

        All of that is coming together in coding - my fulltime study and primary focus going forward.<br> 
        Please feel free to ask me about any of my experiences - I'd be happy to tell you about them, and feel confident that they have all held irreplacable value towards making me a more complete human and interestingly, a better programmer.

Approach
Overall I'm approaching coding as a language, as I taught myself Japanese to fluency. I try to balance these 4:
+ Deconstructive Approach - Daily problems and practice, algorithms and logic, developing the native mindset.
+ Constructive Approach - Lots of personal projects - try to make any idea you can conceptualize.
+ Fundamentals - Follow any course as far as it continues to feel interesting, useful and concise.
+ Community - Open-source projects, and as much collaboration and communication as possible.
