🔭 Currently working on || 現在作業中プロジェクト:<br>

- 🐄 Mostly, enjoying fulfilling work at [One Cow Standing](https://www.onecowstanding.com/). That mostly entails wearing a lot of hats beyond all that hats involved in just modern full stack web/mobile development. Large emphasis on the people we work with, the people we work for, and the good our projects can manifest in the world. 

- ⭐ Assorted webapps at my [github pages hosted site](https://maikupero.github.io/). [React sandbox experiments](https://github.com/maikupero/react_sandbox) with state and hooks.
- 🔧 Diving in: [Plexicon](https://github.com/maikupero/plexicon) Clicker-idle game written for practice in React JS, using Redux for state management. 
- 🤖 Maintaining and expanding: [Squirebot](https://github.com/maikupero/squirebot). 
- 📋 Planned: Develop a reverse [Rikaikun](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp?hl=en) chrome extension for JA/EN learning.
- [Find Us A Game](https://github.com/maikupero/find_us_a_game).
