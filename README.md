🧗‍♂️ About me || 自己紹介:<br>

> During the last 7 years, while living abroad self-supported, I have been:<br>
> a [teacher](http://www.ibe-hiroshima.com/), a [translator](https://amzn.to/3rX6Rxm), a [barista](https://backpackersjapan.co.jp/kyotohostel/en/), a [bike tour company founder & guide](https://biketourjapan.com), a [pilgrim](https://shikoku-tourism.com/en/shikoku-henro/shikoku-henro), a [travel interviewer (i.e Humans of New York)](https://www.instagram.com/sounds_of_japan/), a [photo](https://maikupero.smugmug.com/Photography) / [videographer](https://maikupero.smugmug.com/Videography/), a [local business consultant](https://tecojapan.wordpress.com/), and a [web designer](https://stak.tech).<br>
> Now, I code.<br>
> Creating logical, intuitive programs that connect people with technology fascinates me. The collaborative aspect of building a program, and the constant development inherent in coding practice is joyful. My rich background fills me with ideas for applications, and the ability to connect and communicate with anybody. <br>
> I'm confident that my rich background has made me a more complete human and a better programmer, so please don't hesitate to ask me about any of my experiences.

📝 Approach || 勉強法:<br>
> Overall I'm approaching coding as a language, just as I taught myself to fluency in Japanese. I try to balance these 4:
> + Deconstructive Approach - Daily problems and practice, algorithms and logic, developing the native mindset.
> + Constructive Approach - Lots of personal projects - try to make any idea you can conceptualize.
> + Fundamentals - Follow any course as far as it continues to feel interesting, useful and concise.
> + Community - Open-source projects, and as much collaboration and communication as possible.
